        <p class="histroy-of-jeep">
            In 1941 while the Europe was in the heart of world war II suffering the inevitable destruction due to Nazi attacks, the United States of America
            decided and shopped 135 US Auto manufacturers to create a quick, lightweight reconnaissance vehicle.
            And for the first time the Bantam BRC-40 came out matching all the required conditions of the Army and the government liked it too.<br>
            More BRC-40s were manufactured and shipped to other allied nations and as a total two thousand six hundred and five BRCs were 
            manufactured where 62 of them had the four wheel steering capability which was manufactured according to a request from the United States cavalry. 
            <br>
            The BRC-40 didn't had a gas pedal, there were only a starter button to start the vehicle and a hand throttle to control its speed.
            <br><br>
            With the rapid increase of military vehicle production, the Bantam BRC-40 was not able to reach the required production where it led
            the Army's to recruit the Delmar G ruse the executive vise president and the chief engineer of Willis Overland motors to design a vehicle
            similar to Bantam and as result the Willys MB was created specifically for the military service. And that's how the world first mass 
            jeep production was initiated which are nowadays known as SUV's.
